### Exploring the possibility of generating terrain-dependent non-player character behaviour by using an evolutionary-based fuzzy cognitive map

The purpose of this project is to investigate if Fuzzy Cognitive Maps can be used in combination with Procedural Content Generation, to provide an ecosystem with evolving dynamic behaviour among NPCs in game development. This concept will be explored and visually presented in Unity, which is a popular game engine.
